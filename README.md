Demo for how to stitch together multiple `Dapr` bindings. Although this applies to any supported binding, the example will combine [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/?WT.mc_id=data-0000-abhishgu) and [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/?WT.mc_id=data-0000-abhishgu), where they will be used as Input and Output bindings respectively. All this is done in a simplified manner with no direct reference to Event Hubs or Blob storage in the application code, thanks to the binding based integration.
